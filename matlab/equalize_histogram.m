function J = equalize_histogram(I)
%EQUALIZE_HISTOGRAM Return image parameter with equalized histogram
%   equalize_histogram(I) transforms the grayscale image I so that the
%   histogram of the output grayscale image J is approximately flat

    % your code comes here, start with removing the following line
    J = I;
