function BW = segment_colon(I)
%SEGMENT_CELLS Segment cells in the image
%   segment_colon(I) returns a binary mask (same size as I) representing
%   the skeleton lines between segments (cells of the colon tissue)

    % your code comes here, start with removing the following line
    BW = zeros(size(I));
    
end
