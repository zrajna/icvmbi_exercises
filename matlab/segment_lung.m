function BW = segment_lung(I, p)
%SEGMENT_LUNG Segment image similar to seed
%   segment_lung(I, p) returns a binary mask (same size as I) representing
%   wether the gray values are close to the gray value at point p

    % your code comes here, start with removing the following line
    BW = zeros(size(I));
    
end
