function BW = segment_cells(I, mask)
%SEGMENT_CELLS Segment cells in the image
%   segment_cells(I, mask) returns a binary mask (same size as I)
%   representing the foreground of the image (cells and some background
%   noise in this case)

    % your code comes here, start with removing the following line
    BW = zeros(size(I));
    
end
